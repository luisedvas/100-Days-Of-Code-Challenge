100 Days Of Code Challenge Log

## Day 0: February 21, 2023.

**Todays´s Progress:** Started with HTML. Worked on HTML tags structure for a web page. I added headers, paragraphs, images, comments and some semantic HTML elements, such as main and section.

**Thoughts:** I really not struggled with HTML, overall, I feel I am slowly getting better.
